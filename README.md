Hello, I am Maciej Blankenburg, I have around 3 years commercial experience in Java Development
I am interested in everything that scales well and ensures reliability and high availability.
Currently I am focused on development as a Java Developer + Spring Boot + Devops mainly in Kubernetes / Openshift + GCP Cloud + BigData (Apache Kafka) + Microservices
I have been passionate about IT since I was a child.
I started my adventure with C++, Game Dev and simple websites all the way ending on Java.
Providing services for over 2 years as a hobbyist freelancer, selling custom-made plugins, setting up dedicated VPS game servers and creating simple custom-made websites.
During my studies, I learned a little about microprocesors and deepended my Java knowledge.
I am involved in open-source activities and I am happy to teach new people who want to enter the IT industry.
Ultimately, I'm focused on scaling the application well for that moment in Java, but I'm open to new languages in the future.
