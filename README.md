My name is Maciej Blankenburg. I have been involved in the broadly defined field of IT since my teenage years. I started my journey by creating websites using HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Over time, I have written and modified plugins using Pawn for AMXX for my own needs and at clients requests. I have also learned the basics of C++ and used Arduino as a hobby in IoT projects. Currently, I am focused on writing business applications as a Java Developer and have been working professionally for about 2 years. I am interested in development as a Java Backend Developer or Java Fullstack Developer, preferably in a microservice architecture. I am open to collaborating on interesting and innovative projects.
