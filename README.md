My name is Maciej Blankenburg. I have been involved in the broadly defined IT since my teenage years. I started my journey by creating simple websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for personal use. Over time, I learned the basic C++ language to create and modify plugins for CS 1.6 for my own needs and on request. I used arduino as a hobby in IoT projects. Currently, I focus on writing business applications as Java Developer and has been working commercially for about 2 years. I am interested in development as a java Backend Developer or Java Fullstack Developer preferably in microservice architecture.
Open to collaborating on interesting and innovative projects.
