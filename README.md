Hello 👋, I am Maciej Blankenburg,   
I have around 3 years commercial experience in Java Development ☕.  
I am interested in everything that scales well 📈 and ensures reliability and high availability 🛡️.  
Currently I am focused on development as a:  

 Java Developer mainly in  
  🌱 Spring Boot

Devops mainly in   
☸︎ Kubernetes, docker / podman


I have been passionate about 💻 IT since I was a teenager 👶.  
I started my adventure with C++, Game Dev 🎮 and simple websites all the way ending on Java. 💻  
Providing services for over 2 years on part-time as a hobbyist freelancer, selling custom-made plugins, setting up dedicated VPS game servers and creating simple custom-made websites.  
During my studies, I learned a little about microprocessors and deepened my Java knowledge.  
I am involved in open-source activities, and I am happy to teach new people who want to enter the IT industry   
and I even managed to help a few people   
Ultimately, I'm focused on scaling the application.  
Where there is scaling, there is the future.
